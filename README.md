Hand Gesture Detection using Deep Learning
Overview
This project focuses on developing a hand gesture detection model using deep learning techniques. The primary objective is to recognize different hand gestures in real-time, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience. The model is trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve accurate gesture recognition.

Features
Real-time Detection: The model is capable of recognizing hand gestures in real-time using a webcam.
Multiple Gesture Recognition: Supports recognition of various hand gestures like thumbs up, victory sign, open palm, etc.
Interactive Interface: A user-friendly interface built using Streamlit to interact with the model easily.
Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
models/: Saved models and weight files.
app.py: Streamlit app to run the hand gesture detection interface.
